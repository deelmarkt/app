# DeelMarkt — Development Rules

> These rules are loaded automatically by Claude Code on every session.
> They apply to ALL code changes in this repository. No exceptions.

---

## Project Identity

- **Product:** DeelMarkt — Trust-first Dutch P2P marketplace
- **Stack:** Flutter 3.x + Dart 3.x | Supabase | Mollie | Cloudflare | Cloudinary
- **Architecture:** Clean Architecture + MVVM + Riverpod 3 (feature-first)
- **Languages:** Dart (app), TypeScript (Edge Functions)

## Developer Roles

When a developer identifies themselves, use this to determine their tasks and file ownership.

| Handle | Role | Owns | Sprint Plan Tasks |
|:-------|:-----|:-----|:-----------------|
| **reso** | Backend | `lib/core/services/`, `supabase/`, Edge Functions, DB migrations | Tasks labelled `[R]` in `docs/SPRINT-PLAN.md` |
| **belengaz** | Payments/DevOps | `.github/workflows/`, `codemagic.yaml`, `lib/core/router/`, Mollie, shipping | Tasks labelled `[B]` in `docs/SPRINT-PLAN.md` |
| **pizmam** | Frontend/Design | `lib/widgets/`, `lib/core/design_system/`, `lib/core/l10n/`, screens, tests | Tasks labelled `[P]` in `docs/SPRINT-PLAN.md` |

**When a developer says "I'm reso" or "work on my next task as reso":**
1. Read `docs/SPRINT-PLAN.md`
2. Find tasks labelled `[R]` (or `[B]`/`[P]` for the other devs)
3. Find the first unchecked task in the current sprint
4. Read the relevant epic doc before starting
5. Create or switch to the correct branch (listed in sprint plan)
6. Only modify files within their ownership scope

**When a developer doesn't identify themselves:** Ask "Which developer are you? (reso / belengaz / pizmam)"

## Critical Files to Read Before Any Work

| When | Read |
|:-----|:-----|
| Any task | This file (CLAUDE.md) |
| Developer-specific tasks | `docs/SPRINT-PLAN.md` (find your `[R]`/`[B]`/`[P]` tasks) |
| Architecture questions | `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| Trust/security/legal questions | `docs/COMPLIANCE.md` |
| Feature implementation | The relevant epic in `docs/epics/` |
| UI implementation | `docs/design-system/tokens.md` + relevant pattern file |
| Starting a new session | Run `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` first |

---

## §1 — Architecture Rules

### 1.1 Clean Architecture Layers (never bypass)

```
lib/
├── core/                      # Shared infrastructure
│   ├── design_system/         # Tokens, theme, components
│   ├── l10n/                  # Localisation strings (NL/EN)
│   ├── router/                # GoRouter config
│   ├── services/              # Supabase client, Dio, shared services
│   └── utils/                 # Formatters, validators, extensions
│
├── features/                  # Feature modules (one per domain)
│   └── <feature>/
│       ├── data/              # Repository impls, DTOs, data sources
│       ├── domain/            # Entities, repository interfaces, use cases
│       └── presentation/      # Screens, widgets, ViewModels (Riverpod)
│
├── widgets/                   # Shared UI components (design system)
│
└── main.dart
```

### 1.2 Layer Dependency Rules

- **Presentation → Domain → Data** (never reverse)
- Domain layer is **pure Dart** — no Flutter imports, no Supabase imports
- Data layer implements Domain interfaces — Domain never knows about Supabase
- Presentation uses Riverpod providers to access Domain use cases
- **Never** import from one feature into another — use shared `core/` or `widgets/`

### 1.3 State Management — Riverpod 3

- Use `@riverpod` code generation for all providers
- ViewModels are `AsyncNotifier` or `Notifier` subclasses
- UI reads state via `ref.watch()`, never `ref.read()` in build methods
- Side effects via `ref.read(provider.notifier).method()`
- **No** `setState()`, **no** `ChangeNotifier`, **no** raw `StreamBuilder`

---

## §2 — File Rules

### 2.1 Maximum File Length

| File Type | Max Lines | Action if Exceeded |
|:----------|:----------|:-------------------|
| Screen/Page widget | 200 | Extract sub-widgets into same feature's `presentation/widgets/` |
| ViewModel (Notifier) | 150 | Split into multiple providers or extract use cases |
| Repository implementation | 200 | Split by entity or operation group |
| Use case | 50 | One use case = one public method |
| Model/Entity/DTO | 100 | If exceeded, the model is too large — decompose |
| Test file | 300 | Split into focused test groups |
| Utility/helper | 100 | Split by concern |

### 2.2 Naming Conventions

| Type | Convention | Example |
|:-----|:----------|:--------|
| Files | snake_case | `listing_detail_screen.dart` |
| Classes | PascalCase | `ListingDetailScreen` |
| Providers | camelCase with Provider suffix | `listingDetailProvider` |
| Private members | underscore prefix | `_handleSubmit()` |
| Constants | camelCase | `maxImageCount = 12` |
| Riverpod generated | `@riverpod` annotation | Auto-generates from function name |
| Test files | `*_test.dart` | `listing_detail_screen_test.dart` |
| Localisation keys | snake_case dot-separated | `listing_card.escrow_available` |

### 2.3 Import Rules

- **Relative imports** within a feature: `import '../domain/listing_entity.dart';`
- **Package imports** across features: `import 'package:deelmarkt/core/...';`
- **Never** import from `lib/features/X/` into `lib/features/Y/`
- Group imports: dart → flutter → packages → project (separated by blank lines)

---

## §3 — DRY Principles

### 3.1 Shared Components

Before creating ANY new widget, check:
1. Does it exist in `lib/widgets/`? → Use it
2. Does a similar one exist? → Extend it with parameters
3. Is it feature-specific? → Put in `features/<feature>/presentation/widgets/`
4. Will 2+ features use it? → Put in `lib/widgets/`

### 3.2 Shared Logic

- Business rules → `core/utils/` or domain use cases
- API calls → Repository pattern (never call Supabase from UI)
- Validation → `core/utils/validators.dart`
- Formatting (price, date, distance) → `core/utils/formatters.dart`
- Constants → `core/constants.dart` (never magic numbers in code)

### 3.3 No Duplication Allowed

- **Strings:** All UI text in `core/l10n/*.json` — never hardcoded
- **Colors:** All from `DeelmarktColors` — never `Color(0xFF...)` in widgets
- **Spacing:** All from `Spacing` constants — never raw `16.0` in padding
- **Typography:** All from `DeelmarktTypography` — never inline `TextStyle`
- **Radius:** All from `DeelmarktRadius` — never raw `BorderRadius.circular(12)`

---

## §4 — Design System Rules

### 4.1 Mandatory References

The design system is in `docs/design-system/`:
- **tokens.md** — colours, typography, spacing, radius, elevation, dark mode
- **components.md** — buttons, cards, inputs, badges, states, navigation
- **patterns.md** — trust UI, escrow flow, KYC prompts, chat, shipping, listings
- **accessibility.md** — WCAG 2.2 AA, contrast, touch targets, focus, reduced motion

### 4.2 Before Building Any Screen

1. Read the relevant pattern in `docs/design-system/patterns.md`
2. Check which components from `docs/design-system/components.md` apply
3. Verify colour/spacing tokens from `docs/design-system/tokens.md`
4. Confirm accessibility requirements from `docs/design-system/accessibility.md`

### 4.3 Design System Violations That Block PR

- Hardcoded colour values instead of `DeelmarktColors.*`
- Hardcoded text instead of localisation keys
- Touch targets < 44×44px
- Missing loading/empty/error states
- Missing `Semantics` labels on interactive widgets

---

## §5 — Git Workflow

### 5.1 Branch Strategy

```
main          ← production-ready, protected, never push directly
  └── dev     ← integration branch, PRs from feature branches
       ├── feature/E01-listing-crud
       ├── feature/E02-auth-kyc
       ├── fix/payment-double-charge
       └── chore/update-dependencies
```

### 5.2 Branch Rules

- **Never push to `main` directly** — pre-commit hook blocks this
- **Never push to `dev` directly** — always via PR from feature branch
- Branch naming: `feature/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/` prefix
- One epic = one or more feature branches
- Delete branch after merge

### 5.3 Commit Messages

Format: `type(scope): description`

| Type | Usage |
|:-----|:------|
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `refactor` | Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature |
| `test` | Adding or updating tests |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `chore` | Build, CI, dependencies |
| `style` | Formatting, no logic change |

Example: `feat(listings): add favourite toggle with optimistic UI`

---

## §6 — Testing Rules

### 6.1 Coverage Requirements

- **Minimum 70%** widget + unit test coverage (CI blocks below)
- **100% coverage** on payment paths (E03) — never lower
- Every screen must test: loading state, error state, empty state, data state
- Every form must test: validation rules, submit success, submit failure

### 6.2 Test Structure

```
test/
├── features/
│   └── <feature>/
│       ├── data/          # Repository tests (mock Supabase)
│       ├── domain/        # Use case / business logic tests
│       └── presentation/  # Widget tests + ViewModel tests
├── widgets/               # Shared component tests
└── core/                  # Utility/formatter tests
```

### 6.3 What to Test

| Layer | Test | Mock |
|:------|:-----|:-----|
| Business rules | Pure functions: validation, scoring, tier calculation | Nothing |
| Use cases | Input/output, edge cases | Repository interface |
| ViewModels | State transitions, error handling | Use cases |
| Widgets | Rendering, interaction, async states | Providers (ProviderScope override) |
| Repository | API call mapping, error translation | Supabase client |

## §7 — Pre-Implementation Checklist

Before writing ANY implementation code, complete these steps:

```
[ ] Read the epic doc for the feature being implemented
[ ] Read relevant design system docs (patterns + components)
[ ] List every interactive element (buttons, fields, toggles)
[ ] List every async state (loading, error, empty, data)
[ ] Trace every data path: UI → ViewModel → Use Case → Repository → Supabase
[ ] List every permission/KYC gate
[ ] Confirm all Riverpod providers exist (or create stubs first)
[ ] Run flutter analyze — zero warnings
```

---

## §8 — Quality Gates (enforced by pre-commit hooks)

### On Every Commit

- `dart format --set-exit-if-changed .` — formatting check
- `flutter analyze --no-pub` — static analysis (zero warnings)
- `detect-secrets` — no hardcoded secrets
- No commits to `main` or `dev` directly

### On Every Push

- `flutter test --no-pub` — full test suite must pass
- Coverage ≥ 70% — CI blocks below threshold

### Workflow

```bash
# 1. Format before staging
dart format .

# 2. Stage and commit — hooks run automatically
git add <files>
git commit -m "feat(scope): description"

# 3. Push — test hooks run
git push origin feature/...
```

**Never use `--no-verify`.** Fix the issue instead.

---

## §9 — Supabase Rules

- All tables MUST have RLS policies — no exceptions
- All API keys in Supabase Vault — never in env vars or source code
- Edge Functions use Zod for input validation
- Webhook handlers MUST be idempotent (Upstash Redis NX pattern)
- Database schema changes require a migration file

---

## §10 — Accessibility (Legal Requirement)

The European Accessibility Act is enforceable. These are not optional:

- All interactive elements: ≥ 44×44px touch targets
- All text: ≥ 4.5:1 contrast ratio (3:1 for large text)
- All interactive widgets: `Semantics()` labels in NL + EN
- All animations: respect `MediaQuery.disableAnimations`
- All forms: redundant entry prevention (auto-fill, saved data)
- Focus order follows visual order
- Visible focus indicators on all focusable elements

---

## §11 — Session Workflow

### Starting a Session

1. Read this file (CLAUDE.md)
2. Run `flutter analyze` — establish baseline
3. Run `flutter test` — establish baseline
4. Read the epic for whatever you're implementing
5. Read relevant design system docs

### During Implementation

1. Follow §7 pre-implementation checklist before each screen
2. Run `flutter analyze` after each file change
3. Keep files under line limits (§2.1)
4. Use design system tokens, never raw values (§3.3)

### Before Ending

1. Run `flutter analyze` — zero warnings
2. Run `flutter test` — all passing
3. Commit with proper message format
4. Update epic acceptance criteria checkboxes if applicable
