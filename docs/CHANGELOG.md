# Changelog

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added

- **CLAUDE.md** — development rules auto-loaded by AI agents (architecture, file limits, DRY, git workflow, testing, design system enforcement)
- **.pre-commit-config.yaml** — pre-commit hooks: dart format, flutter analyze, detect-secrets, branch protection (blocks direct push to main/dev); pre-push: flutter test
- **docs/design-system/** — split from 1626-line monolith into 4 focused files:
  - `tokens.md` (colours, typography, spacing, radius, elevation, dark mode)
  - `components.md` (buttons, cards, inputs, badges, states, navigation)
  - `patterns.md` (trust UI, escrow, KYC, chat, shipping, listing detail)
  - `accessibility.md` (WCAG 2.2 AA, contrast, touch targets, focus, motion)

### Changed

- Updated README with setup instructions (pre-commit hooks, secrets baseline, dev branch)
- Added git workflow documentation (main → dev → feature branches)

### Moved to Archives

- `DeelMarkt_Master_Design_System.md` → `docs/archives/` (replaced by split design-system/)
