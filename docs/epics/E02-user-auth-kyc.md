# E02 — User Registration & Progressive KYC

> **Priority:** P0 — Critical | **Phase:** 0–1 (MVP) | **Est. Duration:** 6 weeks

---

## Overview

User registration via Supabase Auth, biometric login, progressive KYC (Levels 0–2 for MVP), user profiles with verification badges, saved addresses for shipping, and GDPR account deletion.

---

## User Stories

### Registration & Auth
- As a new user, I can register with email + phone verification (Level 0)
- As a user, I can log in with biometrics (Face ID / Fingerprint)
- As a user, I can switch between Dutch and English with one tap
- As a user, I can reset my password securely

### Progressive KYC
- As a buyer, I can message sellers after registration (Level 1 — no extra step)
- As a seller, I am prompted for iDIN (or itsme) identity verification when I create my first listing (Level 2)

### Profile & Settings
- As a user, I have a public profile showing verification badges, ratings, and response time
- As a user, I can manage my notification preferences
- As a user, I can add and manage saved addresses (for shipping)
- As a user, I can delete my account and all personal data (GDPR right-to-erasure)

## Technical Scope

### Registration & Auth (3 weeks)
- Supabase Auth (email + phone OTP)
- JWT 15-minute access tokens + refresh tokens
- Biometric auth: Face ID / Fingerprint integration
- Rate-limited login attempts
- Password hashing: bcrypt (cost 12) via Supabase Auth
- **All API keys and third-party credentials (iDIN, Mollie, PostNL) stored in Supabase Vault** — no secrets in env vars or source code

### Progressive KYC — Levels 0–2 (2 weeks)
- **Level 0:** Email + phone verification → browse, save favourites
- **Level 1:** First message trigger → message sellers, make offers (no extra step)
- **Level 2:** First listing trigger → iDIN **or itsme** bank-based identity verification
  - **iDIN:** Supported by ING, Rabobank, ABN AMRO — primary for Dutch users
  - **itsme:** Popular with younger Dutch users and Belgian users (relevant given Bancontact/Belgium scope)
  - User is offered whichever provider their bank supports; falls back to the other if unavailable
- Verification badge system on user profiles
- KYC state machine with clear transitions
- `kyc_level` column in users table referenced by RLS policies

### Profile, Addresses & GDPR (1 week)
- Public profile page: badges, ratings, member since, response time
- Saved addresses table (postcode, huisnummer, toevoeging, city)
- Account deletion Edge Function: async PII deletion within 30 days, audit log preserved
- Data export endpoint (JSON) for GDPR portability

### Phase 2 Additions
- **Level 3:** First escrow transaction → Onfido selfie + document verification
- **Level 4:** Monthly €2,500+ sales → KVK number + KYBC verification
